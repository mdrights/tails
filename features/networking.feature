Feature: Networking

  Scenario: No initial network
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    And I wait between 30 and 60 seconds
    Then the Tor Status icon tells me that Tor is not usable
    When the network is plugged
    Then Tor is ready
    And the Tor Status icon tells me that Tor is usable
    And all notifications have disappeared
    And the time has synced

  Scenario: The Tails Greeter "disable all networking" option disables networking within Tails
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and stopped at Tails Greeter's login screen
    And I disable all networking in the Tails Greeter
    And I log in to a new session
    Then no network interfaces are enabled
    When I hotplug a network device
    And I wait 10 seconds
    Then no network interfaces are enabled

  Scenario: The "Tor is ready" notification is shown when Tor has bootstrapped
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    And the network is plugged
    When Tor is ready
    Then I see the "Tor is ready" notification after at most 30 seconds
