- **<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>**

  Without an article. Not *the Greeter*. Note the formatting as an application.

- **startup options**

  To refer to the kernel command line options that can be specified from
  the *Boot Loader Menu*.

  * *For example:* Adding `radeon.dpm=0` to the [[startup
    options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

- *Debian and Ubuntu version*

  Refer to Debian versions primarily by their number, and additionally
  by their codename.

  * For example:
    - Tails 3.0 is based on Debian 9 (Stretch)
    - *Tails Installer* is available on Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) or later.
