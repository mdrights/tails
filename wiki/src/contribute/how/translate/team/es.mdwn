[[!meta title="Translate Tails into Spanish"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

* We try to translate using Tails itself so we get familiarised with the
  software we are translating.
* We have one main communication channel: A [mailing list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)
  (<tails-l10n-spanish@boum.org>).
* We have [[a wiki|blueprint/l10n_Spanish]].
* We use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) for the translations (comes with Tails).
* The first documents to translate should be the
  [[core pages|contribute/l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt]].

If you want to contribute, please contact us first through the mailing list.
