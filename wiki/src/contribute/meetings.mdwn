Each month Tails contributors gather for an online meeting in which
everybody is welcome to attend: existing contributors and those who want
to become one.

- **Date**:
  - The **3rd** day of the month if it's a day between Monday and
    Thursday (inclusive)
  - The **6th** day of the month otherwise
- **Time**: 20:00 Berlin time (18:00 or 19:00 UTC, depending on the date)
- **Location**: [[`tails-dev` XMPP chatroom|contribute/chat]]

If you want to get involved but don't know yet how, please introduce
yourself during the meeting, and be sure to tell us what you are
interested in.

The meeting might not be the most adequate time and place to properly
introduce newcomers to the development process, but at least it should
be a fine place to know each others, and schedule a better suited event.

# Preparing a discussion

To have fruitful discussions we prepare them to make sure that:

  - The meeting is the right place for a given discussion; otherwise it
    should be redirected to mailing lists or Redmine.
  - Enough information is available; especially if a decision has to be
    made.
  - The required people or skills are present.
  - The discussion is lead in a fruitful way.

If you want to propose a discussion:

  - Make sure that it corresponds to a
    [[Redmine|contribute/working_together/Redmine]] ticket with:

    - *Discuss* as its *Type of Work*
    - You as its *Assignee*
    - Detailed enough information on the ticket

  - Add it to the [[blueprint of the agenda|blueprint/monthly_meeting]].

Discussions with no assignee will be postponed.

# Instructions for taking notes

  - Store a full log of the meeting along in attachment to your minutes.
  - Explain in details the decisions that were taken.
  - Keep track of the brainstorming that we did if no decision was
    taken.
  - Include names of people who took responsibilities.
  - Update Redmine tickets accordingly and point them to the meeting
    notes (unless someone else volunteers to do it on some tickets).
  - Remove from the [[blueprint of the agenda|blueprint/monthly_meeting]]
    all topics that don't require further discussion.
