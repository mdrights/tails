[[!meta title="Releasing Thunderbird"]]

Until we have
[[!tails_ticket 6156 desc="upstreamed our secure autoconfiguration patches"]]
we have to maintain Thunderbird ourselves. This means we need to
[[!debpts thunderbird]] new versions hitting Debian stable.

The first time you do this requires some additional steps (WARNING!
this will download almost 2 GiB of data):

1. Clone [Tails' Thunderbird repo](http://git.tails.boum.org/thunderbird/).

1. Add a remote for Debian:

        git remote add debian-upstream https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-mozilla/icedove.git

Let's pretend the scenario is that Thunderbird 45.3.0-1 has just been
released:

    VERSION=45.8.0-3
    TAG="debian/1%${VERSION:?}"

1. `git fetch && git fetch debian-upstream`

1. Verify the signed tag:

        git tag -v "${TAG:?}"

   The tag should have been signed with one of the keys that follow;
   investigate if it's not the case:

    - `8B94 819C 2555 70A3 74B6  2CCD 26E3 C875 A744 20EF`
    - `B70D FC6F 134F ECFC 011E  62AA 8301 6014 251D 1DB0`
    - `D343 9DAA 19DC FACD AE87  9CF2 B999 CDB5 8C8D DBD2`

1. Let's update our branch to the new version:

        git checkout tails/stretch && git merge origin/tails/stretch && \
        git merge --no-edit "${TAG:?}"

   Now you most likely will have to deal with a merge conflict in
   `debian/changelog` -- just reorder the conflicting entries by
   version number, `git add` modified files as needed, and ensure
   a merge commit is created eventually.

1. Let's ensure our patches still apply cleanly:

   1. Check if they do:

          quilt push -a

   2. Regardless of whether our  they do, clean up:

          quilt pop -a && rm -rf .pc

   3. If our patches applied cleanly, move on. Otherwise:

      XXX (undocumented as we prefer focusing our efforts on
      upstreaming our patches than on documenting the current,
      temporary state of things): after reverse-engineering the state
      of our Git repository, it seems that one should create a new
      `secure_account_creation-${VERSION:?}` branch forked of the
      latest existing one, transplant our commits on top of `${TAG}`
      with the appropriate `--onto` option, squash our commits into
      a new `secure_account_creation-${VERSION:?}-squashed` branch,
      extract updated patches from there into
      `debian/patches/secure-account-creation/`.

1. Then let's release a new version:

        TAILS_VERSION="1:${VERSION:?}+tails1" && \
        DISTRIBUTION="feature-thunderbird-${VERSION:?}" && \
        dch \
           --newversion "${TAILS_VERSION:?}" \
           --force-bad-version \
           --distribution "${DISTRIBUTION:?}" \
           --force-distribution \
           "Rebuild Thunderbird with Tails' secure autoconfiguration patches." && \
        git commit debian/changelog \
            -m "document changes and release ${TAILS_VERSION:?}"

1. Fetch the Debian sources to be used for the build:

        ICEDOVE_SOURCES="$(mktemp -d)" && \
        GIT_DIR="$(pwd)" && \
        cd "${ICEDOVE_SOURCES:?}" && \
        apt --download-only source thunderbird="1:${VERSION:?}" && \
        mkdir -p "${GIT_DIR:?}/../tarballs/" && \
        for tarball in icedove_*.orig*.tar.xz ; do
           ln -s \
              "${GIT_DIR:?}/../tarballs/$tarball" \
              "${GIT_DIR:?}/../$tarball"
        done
        cp icedove_*.orig*.tar.xz "${GIT_DIR:?}/../tarballs/" && \
        cd "${GIT_DIR:?}" && \
        rm -rf "${ICEDOVE_SOURCES:?}"

   Note: we cannot use the `pristine-tar` branch since Jessie builds
   expect split .orig sources for l10n stuff, which is not the case in
   Sid, which `pristine-tar` is made for. Or something like
   this. Let's not waste time on investigating this.

1. Build packages in a Stretch amd64 chroot:

        gbp buildpackage \
            --git-debian-branch=tails/stretch \
            --git-no-pristine-tar \
            --git-export=WC

1. Tag the new version:

        gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=tails/stretch \
            --git-sign-tags --git-tag-only

1. Include all sources in the `.changes` file:

        CHANGES_FILE="../thunderbird_${VERSION}+tails1_amd64.changes" && \
        changestool "${CHANGES_FILE:?}" includeallsources

1. Due to [[!tails_ticket 11531]] we won't be able to push the tag
   generated by `gbp` so we have to replace it with a differently
   named tag:

        NEW_TAG="$(echo ${TAG:?} | sed 's/1%//')" && \
        git tag -s "${NEW_TAG:?}" -m "thunderbird Debian release 1:${VERSION:?}" "${TAG:?}" && \
        TAG="${NEW_TAG:?}"

1. Git push and upload packages:

        git push --follow-tags origin tails/stretch && \
        debsign "${CHANGES_FILE:?}" && \
        dupload --to tails "${CHANGES_FILE:?}"

   At the moment pushing `$TAG` may fail due to
   [[!tails_ticket 11531]]. We'll just have to save these tags locally
   until when it's solved, and then push...
