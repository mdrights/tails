# *** WARNING about debug_file and debug_directory *********************
#
# Great attention must be given to the ownership situation of these
# files and their parent directories in order to avoid a symlink-based
# attack that could read the contents of any file and make it
# accessible to the user running this script (typicall the live
# user). Therefore, when adding a new file, give as the first argument
# 'root' only if the complete path to it (including the file itself)
# is owned by root and already exists before the system is connected to
# the network (that is, before GDM's PostLogin script is run).
# If not, the following rules must be followed strictly:
#
# * only one non-root user is involved in the ownership situation (the
#   file, its dir and the parent dirs). From now on let's assume it is
#   the case and call it $USER.
#
# * if any non-root group has write access, it must not have any
#   members.
#
# If any of these rules does not apply, the file cannot be added here
# safely and something is probably quite wrong and should be
# investigated carefully.
